				<h1>Music 220B Homework #1</h1>

				<h2>Running the Code</h2>
				<p>
					All code and recordings can be found at
					this <a href="https://github.com/nshaheed/220b/tree/main/hw1">github
					repo</a>. The .ck files are appropriately named. All of them
					should be runnable by opening them in miniAudicle and
					clicking the "Add Shred" button. 
				</p>
				
				<h2>Sound Logo for my Chapman Stick</h2>
				<p>
					My sound logo is derived from, and for,
					my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7kIclA4yq4">chapman
					stick</a>, which is a polyphonic, 8-12 stringed instrument
					in the electric guitar family that I've been playing for
					almost 2 years. This is part of a slow process of
					introducing it into my compositional work.
				</p>

				<p>
					The sound source for the logo is a recording of me playing a
					chord, which is then reversed
					(ala <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPCLFtxpadE">Roundabout</a>).

					The stick has a big range (it's effectively a bass and a
					guitar), so I tried making the chord pretty big and spread
					out.

					This audio file is then played back a bunch of times in
					quick succession on top of each other. Each playback has a
					heavily Q'd ResonZ filter at a random freq so that you only
					get a small slice of the recording. This turns the reversal
					sound into more of a textural effect.
				</p>

				<p>
					The progression from this piece comes from me changing the
					variables surrounding the file playback. As the program
					progresses, the rhythm gets more regular, the frequency
					range of the filters increases from high to low, the Q is
					decreased, and the panning field expands. It's closed out
					with the full audio file being played. The whole thing is
					basically a big crescendo.
				</p>

				<h2>Chucku #1</h2>
				<p>
					This first chucku is super noisy. It's an expansion of
					kijjaz's <a href="https://electro-music.com/forum/post-95506.html#95506">intergalactic
						sound check</a>.

					I played around with two PitShfit feeding into each other,
					the first is slightly higher than its input and the second
					is much, much lower. This seems to create an interesting
					dynamic, unstable, noisy system that has lots of fun twists and turns.

				<p>
					Warning: LOUD

				<h2>Chucku #2</h2>
				<p>
					This one is just a simple repetitive tone, with a randomized
					rhythm. I enjoy the regularity of it (but it's not too
					regular on account of the randomness).
